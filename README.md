TIME COMPLEXITY:
It is not the time taken by the code to run because this time is dependent on the system.Eg: Windows might take more time to run a code as compared to Mac.
It is the rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.(theta graph)
Three steps:
1.Always compute time complexity in terms of worst case scenario.(Best, Average, Worst)
2.Avoid constants.
3.Avoid lower values.
SPACE COMPLEXITY:
It is the memory space that a program takes.
Auxiliary space(space that you take to solve the problem)+Input space(Space that you take to store the input).

Generally , most of the servers(leetcode,GFG, etc) takes 1 second for 10^8 operations. 2 seconds for 2*10^8 opeartions.
