//Arrays are of fixed size and are in contiguous memory location.
//so we can neither increase nor decrease the size of the array.
//so linkedlist comes in.
//It is a data structure which helps to increase as well as decrease the size.
//Linkedlist is not in contiguous memory location.
//Starting point of the linked list is called HEAD of the linked list.
