         //Introduction to Graphs

//Types of Graph:
//1.Undirected Graph
//2.Directed graph :arrows

//Nodes/vertex
//Edges:Line between nodes.
//In undirectional graph , edges can be bidirectional.u->v as well as v->u
//Directed graph: Directed edges. u->v only. We can also have birectional edges.


//Cycles in a graph:
//A graph does not necessarily means that it has to be an enclosed structure, it can be open as well.

//CYCLE:Start from a node and end at that node.
