//The prefix sum method is a technique used in programming, especially in scenarios involving cumulative sums or range queries. 
//It involves precomputing cumulative sums of an array or sequence of values to facilitate quick calculations of sums over any subarray or range within that sequence.

//Computing Prefix Sums:
//Start with an array where each element represents the cumulative sum up to that index.
//For example, if you have an array arr of size n, the prefix sum array prefix would be computed such that prefix[i] contains the sum of all elements from arr[0] to arr[i].
