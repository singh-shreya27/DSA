                            //Quick sort
//This also has T.C. similar to merge sort but it does not uses any extra space unlie merge sort.
//T.C: O(n*log2n)
//S.C:O(1)
//STEPS:
//STEP1:pick a pivot and place it in its correct place in the sorted array.
//there is no rule to pick up the pivot element.
//a. 1st element in the array.
//b. last element in the array.
//c. median of the array.
//d. random element of the array.
//STEP2:smaller on the left and larger on the right.
